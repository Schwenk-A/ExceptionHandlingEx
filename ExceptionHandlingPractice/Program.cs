//this is a companion to the Exception Handling Notes. 


/* Our goal is to create our own custom exceptions for each of the exercises below and then if you have completed the 
 * try-catch-finally- throw worksheet as well try to use try-catch or try-catch-finally to resolve the exception all together. 
 
 * Some methods were created in the BrokenCode class, and as each section of code will cause an exception you will need to 
 * uncomment out each section as you work through each one.*/


//Exercise 1:____________________________________________________________


var badUserInput = 0;
var result = BrokenCode.DivideByZeroError(badUserInput);


//Exercise 2: ____________________________________________________________


//List<string> badList = new List<string> { "mark", "John", "Richard" };
//Console.WriteLine(badList[4]);
