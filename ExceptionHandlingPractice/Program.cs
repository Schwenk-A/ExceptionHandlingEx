//this is a companion to the Exception Handling Notes. 


/* Our goal is to create our own custom exceptions for each of the exercises below and try throwing your new exceptions
 * then if you have completed the try-catch-finally-throw worksheet as well try to use try-catch or try-catch-finally 
 * to resolve the exception all together. 
 
 * Some methods were created in the BrokenCode class, and as each section of code will cause an exception you will need to 
 * uncomment out each section as you work through each one.*/


//Exercise 1:_____________________________________________________________


//var badUserInput = 0;
//var result = BrokenCode.DivideByZeroError(badUserInput);
//Console.WriteLine(result);

//Exercise 2: ____________________________________________________________


//List<string> badList = new List<string> { "mark", "John", "Richard" };
//Console.WriteLine(badList[4]);


//Exercise 3: ____________________________________________________________

//string badString = string.Empty;
//basString = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(@"C:\file.txt");


//Exercise 4: ____________________________________________________________

//var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 3, 5 };
//var firstNumHigherThanFive = numbers.Where(x => x > 5).First();
